# emanote

Write plain-text notes, but do complex things with it - such as to eman**a**te a smart notebook.

> *emanate*: (of something abstract but perceptible) issue or spread out from (a source).

## Purpose

Goals: large **private** Zettelkastens, **dynamic** navigation, simplicity, performance.

Non-goals: static site publishing, theming.

Maybe-goals: use `emanote-core` as a core library in neuron.

## Give it a test-drive

Clone the source, and read `./doc/Development.md`

## Demo

My public wiki is running on Emanote: https://w.srid.ca/
