# emanote

Write plain-text notes, but do complex things with it - such as to eman**a**te a smart notebook.

> *emanate*: (of something abstract but perceptible) issue or spread out from (a source).

## Purpose

Goals: large **private** Zettelkastens, **dynamic** navigation, simplicity, performance.

Non-goals: static site publishing, theming.

Maybe-goals: use `emanote-core` as a core library in neuron.

## Give it a test-drive

The canonical location of the source code is [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/); get it from here: `rad:git:hwd1yred516gwfzodm7cnyeyh1b17s4xw7jex4obi6rdt1c3xygo4r4cxbo`

Then read `./doc/Development.md`

## When will it be released?

I plan to move srid.ca to use emanote by mid-Feb. My private Zettelkasten already is using emanote.
