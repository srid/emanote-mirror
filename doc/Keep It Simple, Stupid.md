> Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible. ---Alan Kay.

Emanote expects only two things from your notebook:

- It is written in [Markdown format](https://commonmark.org/)
- Notes are linked using established wiki-links (`[[..]]`)

As long as you stick to these expectations, your notebook remains simple and there is less chance of being locked-in to idiosyncratic software.
