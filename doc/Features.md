- Emanote gives life to a directory of Markdown files
  - Just start writing your `.md` files in any sub-directory
  - emanote will create a "living view" of it.
- Fully dynamic website ("living view")
  - Realtime updates: view updates as you modify your `.md` files
    - This feature can be disabled in `config/backend/readOnly`
  - `IN-ROADMAP` Folgezettel-based search & navigation
- Link to notes that need not exist
  - Linking as `[[Foo]]` for example, will treat "Foo" as a legitimate note even if "Foo.md" does not exist on disk. This enables "tagging" a note with some folgezettel parent (eg. `#[[Review]]`) without being forced to create an empty Markdown file ("Review.md") on disk.
- [[Pretty URLs]]
- `IN-ROADMAP` Pandoc filters 
- `IN-ROADMAP` Plugins (calendar, tasks, etc.)
