## What's emanote?

Srid's playground for uninhibitedly exploring the problem-space of [Unix-pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix))-based transformation of a directory of Markdown files (or anything!) to sophisticated structures like directed graphs, all the while supporting end-to-end incremental updates (as your files change, so will the graph---instantly).

Interested in trying out, or hacking?

  - Haskell's [STM](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/software-transactional-memory.html) (incremental patchig of in-memory database).
