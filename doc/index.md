## What's emanote?

Srid's playground for uninhibitedly exploring the problem-space of [Unix-pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix))-based transformation of a directory of Markdown files (or anything!) to sophisticated structures like directed graphs, all the while supporting end-to-end incremental updates (as your files change, so will the graph---instantly). Also, using a fully dynamic frontend rather than being limited to what a statically generated site can ofter.
